#  description: "Justin graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in Biochemistry and Biophysics. \
#  He conducted research in both the laboratories of Dr. Elisar Barbar studying dynein protein interactions, and Dr. P. Andrew \
#  Karplus conducting structural bioinformatic research on protein structural components from ultra-high resolution protein \
#  crystal structures. As a graduate student  in the Fraser lab, he examined the how conformational heterogeneity changed \
#  during directed evolution and revealed minor states that resulted from ligand binding. He was supported by a graduate \
#  fellowship from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/). As a staff scientist, he is now building up capabilities for high-throughput ligand soaking \
#  experiments."
